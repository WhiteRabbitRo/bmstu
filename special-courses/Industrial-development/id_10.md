# Industrial Development 10
## Refactoring

when to refactor:

- after feature implementation
- look for dev cycle
- boy scout's rule `saw bad code - refactor`

New branch should be made for refactoring/bugfix/etc.

`For branch naming`: namespaces should be used. For example: `release/<issue>` or `devtask/<issue>`

`In commit massage`: verb should be used in past tense and hachtag with task id should be added.

For tasks:
- if task if >4 hours hard - subdivide
- if for task implementation sub components required - add tasks

For dev task:

- should be implementable in 4-8 hours

For bugfix:

- add environment description
- add logs
- add screenshots
- link with similar

For new feature:

- describe current state
- describe why new feature is needed
- new feature should be voted on/ discussed

Task description should require ~30 mins to make.
It is important to state if task blocks another task

## Documentation

- how to build (docker/different environments)
- how to build tests
- how to run (1-2 commands is optimal number of commands)
- additional: doxygen comments
- additional: how to generate documentation

- Doxygen commenting should be automatic
- Examples should be added

## Packaging

- packs over code: faster and dependencies are better defined

## Sanitizers

ASAN, TSAN, MSAN, valgrind, etc can be used with `polly`, declared as toolchain

## Package manager
